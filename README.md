# Valentine’s Day Envelope App

A **personal project** created for a fun, interactive Valentine’s Day experience. When you hover over the envelope, it smoothly transitions from closed to open, revealing a letter inside.

## Overview

- **Closed Envelope → Open Envelope**: CSS animations fade out the unopened envelope and fade in two pieces of the opened envelope plus the letter.
- **Hover-Based Interactivity**: No clicks or other events needed—simply hover to trigger the transition.
- **Personal Touch**: Designed specifically as a sweet surprise, not intended as a professional or public-facing product.

## Features

- **CSS Keyframes & Transitions**
  Smoothly animate envelope states and letter movement.
- **SVG Graphics**
  Crisp, scalable envelope art for both closed and open states.
- **Lighthearted Vibe**
  A whimsical envelope animation set against a soft, romantic background color.

## Project Structure (High-Level)

- **`App.tsx`**
  Defines the main layout, including the `<div>` elements for the closed envelope, opened envelope pieces, and letter.
- **`App.css`**
  Manages all the hover animations, positioning, and the envelope reveal logic.
- **`assets/`**
  Contains the SVG files for the unopened envelope, opened envelope top flap, and opened envelope base.

## Notes & Future Ideas

- **Countdown or Riddle**
  Potentially add a special countdown to Valentine’s Day or a hidden puzzle for extra engagement.
- **Mobile Friendliness**
  Currently focused on hover effects—could adapt to tap/click for better mobile support.
- **Further Personalization**
  Customize the letter’s contents, add images or messages that appear when fully opened.

## Why a Personal Project?

This app is purely a **personal endeavor**, built as a fun, heartfelt way to explore CSS animations and create a memorable digital Valentine’s Day surprise. It’s not part of a professional portfolio or intended for general release—just a creative expression of code and sentiment.
